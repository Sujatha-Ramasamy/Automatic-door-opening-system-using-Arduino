# Automatic Door Opening System using Arduino

## Overview

This Arduino program controls an automatic door opening system using an ultrasonic sensor and a servo motor. When an object is detected within a specified range, the system opens the door, and it closes after a certain delay.

## Components

- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- Servo motor
- Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)
- Jumper wires
- Power supply for Arduino

## Wiring

- Connect the ultrasonic sensor's trigPin to Arduino pin 9 and echoPin to pin 10.
- Attach the servo motor to Arduino pin 8 or any other suitable PWM pin.
- Power the Arduino board.

## Usage

1. Upload the provided Arduino sketch to your Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.
2. Ensure that the wiring is correct and all components are connected.
3. Power on the Arduino board.
4. The system will continuously monitor the ultrasonic sensor for objects.
5. When an object is detected within the specified range (default is 20 cm), the door will open.
6. The door will close automatically after a predefined delay (default is 2 seconds).
7. You can adjust the distance threshold and delay times in the code to suit your requirements.

## Configuration

You can modify the following parameters in the Arduino code to customize the system:

- `openAngle`: The angle at which the servo opens the door.
- `closeAngle`: The angle at which the servo closes the door.
- `distanceThreshold`: The distance (in centimeters) at which the system triggers the door to open.
- `delayTime`: The delay (in milliseconds) for which the door remains open.
